In order for entries in a database to be\n * somewhat easily traceable back to the code which produced them, events sent\n * through analytics should be defined here.\n *\n * Since the AnalyticsAdapter API can be used in different ways, for some events\n * it is more convenient to just define the event name as a constant. For other\n * events a factory function is easier.\n *\n * A general approach for adding a new event:\n * 1. Determine the event type: track, UI, page, or operational. If in doubt use\n * operational.\n * 2. Determine whether the event is related to other existing events, and\n * which fields are desired to be set: name, action, actionSubject, source.\n * 3. If the name is sufficient (the other fields are not important), use a\n * constant. Otherwise use a factory function.\n *\n * Note that the AnalyticsAdapter uses the events passed to its functions for\n * its own purposes, and might modify them. Because of this, factory functions\n * should create new objects.\n *\n */\n\n/**\n * The constant which identifies an event of type \"operational\".\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const TYPE_OPERATIONAL = 'operational';\n\n/**\n * The constant which identifies an event of type \"page\".\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const TYPE_PAGE = 'page';\n\n/**\n * The constant which identifies an event of type \"track\".\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const TYPE_TRACK = 'track';\n\n/**\n * The constant which identifies an event of type \"ui\".\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const TYPE_UI = 'ui';\n\n/**\n * The \"action\" value for Jingle events which indicates that the Jingle session\n * was restarted (TODO: verify/fix the documentation)\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const ACTION_JINGLE_RESTART = 'restart';\n\n/**\n * The \"action\" value for Jingle events which indicates that a session-accept\n * timed out (TODO: verify/fix the documentation)\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const ACTION_JINGLE_SA_TIMEOUT = 'session-accept.timeout';\n\n/**\n * The \"action\" value for Jingle events which indicates that a session-initiate\n * was received.\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const ACTION_JINGLE_SI_RECEIVED = 'session-initiate.received';\n\n/**\n * The \"action\" value for Jingle events which indicates that a session-initiate\n * not arrived within a timeout (the value is specified in\n * the {@link JingleSessionPC}.\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const ACTION_JINGLE_SI_TIMEOUT = 'session-initiate.timeout';\n\n/**\n * A constant for the \"terminate\" action for Jingle events.

The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the\n * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n * invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?

Class implements <tt>LoggerTransport</tt>\n * and thus can be added as global transport in order to capture all the logs.\n *\n * It captures subsequent log lines created whenever <tt>Logger</tt> logs\n * a message and stores them in a queue in order to batch log entries. There are\n * time and size limit constraints which determine how often batch entries are\n * stored. Whenever one of these limits is exceeded the <tt>LogCollector</tt>\n * will use the <tt>logStorage</tt> object given as an argument to save\n * the batch log entry.\n *\n * @param {Object} logStorage an object which allows to store the logs collected\n * @param {function(string|object[])} logStorage.storeLogs a method called when\n * this <tt>LogCollector</tt> requests log entry storage. The method's argument\n * is an array which can contain <tt>string</tt>s and <tt>object</tt>s. If given\n * item is an object it means that it's an aggregated message. That is a message\n * which is the same as the previous one and it's representation has\n * the following format:\n * {\n *   {string} text: 'the text of some duplicated message'\n *   {number} count: 3 // how many times the message appeared in a row\n * }\n * If a message \"B\" after an aggregated message \"A\" is different, then it breaks\n * the sequence of \"A\". Which means that even if the next message \"C\" is\n * the same as \"A\" it will start a new aggregated message \"C\".\n * @param {function()} logStorage.isReady a method which should return\n * a <tt>boolean</tt> to tell the collector that it's ready to store. During the\n * time storage is not ready log batches will be cached and stored on the next\n * occasion (flush or interval timeout).\n *\n * @param {Object} options the <tt>LogCollector</tt> configuration options.\n * @param {number} options.maxEntryLength the size limit for a single log entry\n * to be stored. The <tt>LogCollector</tt> will push the entry as soon as it\n * reaches or exceeds this limit given that <tt>logStorage.isReady</tt>\n * returns <tt>true</tt>.
